## 🌐 Project Overview

**JobHirence** is a user-friendly online job portal system developed after analyzing multiple job sites to address common challenges in recruitment platforms. The key goal of this project is to streamline the hiring process for both job seekers and employers—making it more efficient, flexible, and accessible.

One of the standout features of JobHirence is the dual-role functionality, where a user can apply for jobs as a candidate and also act as an employer to post and manage their own job listings. This empowers users to hire candidates, manage applications, and build a network—all from a single account.

Built with PHP, Laravel, and MySQL, it features real-time tracking, social login, password recovery, and role-based panels for users, companies, and admins—reducing manual work and improving efficiency in hiring workflows.
